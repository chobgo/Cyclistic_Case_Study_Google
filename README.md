# Case Study: CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE COMPANY 

## INTROUCTION

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders.  Maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. There is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members.

The Company wants to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

## SCENARIO

I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Guiding Questions

   **Where is your data located?**

The project will use the data provided by Google using the following link: [divvy_tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

   **How is the data organized?**

The data is organized into 12 CSV files. Each file is structured by year and month. For example, the file named 202004-divvy-tripdata contains information about the various trips taken by the company's customers in April 2020. The available data includes details such as date, trip ID, start station, end station, and whether the customer is a member or a casual rider, among other attributes.

In this analysis, I have considered the last 12 months of data, from February 2024 to January 2025.

   **Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?**

Regarding the credibility of the data, since it is collected and provided by the company itself—meaning it is first-party data—and considering that this is a case study, I assume that the information is reliable and meets the ROCCC analysis criteria.

In other words, it is a reliable source because the data is collected and provided directly by the company. It is original as it comes from the actual usage of the bicycles by the company's customers. It is comprehensive since the data is structured in rows and columns with clear, descriptive names. It is current, as it includes the last 12 months of data, from February 2024 to January 2025. Lastly, it is cited, as it originates from the company itself.

   **How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?**

The data belongs to the company and is publicly available under a license. Therefore, there is explicit consent from the company to use this information. Additionally, the data complies with privacy measures by not disclosing any personal information about customers, thereby protecting their identity and sensitive details. The dataset only includes information related to bicycle usage and routes. No sensitive data is included, and all information is fully anonymized.

   **How did you verify the data’s integrity?**

All the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data.

   **How does it help you answer your question?**

It may have some key insights about the riders and their riding style

   **Are there any problems with the data?**

It would be good to have some updated information about the bike stations. Also more information about the riders could be useful.
