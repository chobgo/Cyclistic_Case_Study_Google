# Case Study: CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE COMPANY 

## INTROUCTION

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders.  Maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. There is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members.

The Company wants to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

## SCENARIO

I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## FASE 1: ASK

### BUSINESS TASK

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members based on an understanding of how
annual members and casual riders use their rental bikes differently.
